- üìù **All custom information fields** you've created

**Advanced Features:**
- üéØ **Selective Sync** - Copy only specific contacts/deals and their related data
- üîÑ **Rollback & Undo** - Reverse changes if something goes wrong
- üßπ **Granular Reset** - Remove only records, only properties, or everything
- üìä **Detailed Reporting** - Track exactly what was copied

## Who This Is For

- **Business owners** who want to backup their HubSpot data
- **Marketing teams** who need a testing environment
- **Consultants** who manage multiple HubSpot accounts
- **Anyone** who needs to copy HubSpot data safely

**No coding experience required!** Just follow the steps below.

## What You Need Before Starting

1. **Two HubSpot accounts**: 
   - Source account (where your data is now)
   - Destination account (where you want to copy it)

2. **Access to both accounts**: You need to be an admin or have data permissions

3. **A computer** with internet access (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

## Step-by-Step Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Download This Tool

**Option A - If you know Git:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modern-hubspot-migration.git
cd modern-hubspot-migration
```

**Option B - Simple download:**
1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
2. Click "Download ZIP" 
3. Extract the ZIP file to your computer
4. Open the extracted folder

### Step 2: Install Python (if you don't have it)

**Windows:**
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH"

**Mac:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `python3 --version` (if you see a version number, you're good!)
3. If not installed, go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)

**Already have Python?** Skip to Step 3.

### Step 3: Setup the Tool

Open your command line/terminal in the tool folder and run these commands:

```bash
# Install required components
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the example configuration
cp config/config.example.ini config/config.ini
```

### Step 4: Get Your HubSpot Access Keys

You need to create "Private Apps" in both HubSpot accounts to get access keys.

**In your SOURCE HubSpot account (where data is now):**

1. Go to Settings ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Private Apps
2. Click "Create a private app"
3. Give it a name like "Migration Tool - Source"
4. Go to the "Scopes" tab and select these permissions:
   
   **CRM Objects (Read & Write):**
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
   - `crm.objects.companies.read`
   - `crm.objects.companies.write`
   - `crm.objects.deals.read`
   - `crm.objects.deals.write`
   
   **Properties & Schema:**
   - `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
   - `crm.schemas.contacts.write` (for custom properties)
   - `crm.schemas.companies.read`
   - `crm.schemas.companies.write` (for custom properties)
   - `crm.schemas.deals.read`
   - `crm.schemas.deals.write` (for custom properties)
   
   **Pipelines (for Deals):**
   - `crm.objects.deals.read` (already included above)
   - `sales-email-read` (if using sales features)
   
   **Associations:**
   - `crm.objects.associations.read` (or legacy: `crm.associations.read`)
   - `crm.objects.associations.write` (or legacy: `crm.associations.write`)
5. Click "Create app"
6. Copy the access token (starts with `pat-na1-`)

**In your DESTINATION HubSpot account (where you want to copy data):**

Repeat the same steps above, but name it "Migration Tool - Destination"

### Step 5: Configure the Tool

Edit the file `config/config.ini` with a text editor and add your access tokens:

```ini
[hubspot]
production_token = pat-na1-YOUR-SOURCE-TOKEN-HERE
sandbox_token = pat-na1-YOUR-DESTINATION-TOKEN-HERE

[migration]
contact_limit = 50
```

**Important:** Replace the example tokens with your real tokens from Step 4.

## Running the Migration

### Test First (Recommended)

Always test with a few contacts first:

```bash
# Test with just 5 contacts (no actual changes made)
python migrate.py --dry-run --limit 5

# If the test looks good, try migrating 5 contacts for real
python migrate.py --limit 5
```

### Full Migration

When you're ready to copy all your data:

```bash
# Copy all contacts, companies, and deals
python migrate.py

# Copy only contacts and their related data
python migrate.py --contacts-only

# Copy only deals and their related data  
python migrate.py --deals-only
```

### Advanced Features

#### Selective Sync - Copy Only What You Need

Copy only specific contacts and their related deals:

```bash
# Copy contacts created in the last 7 days with all their deals
python migrate.py --selective-contacts --days-since-created 7

# Copy specific contacts by ID with their deals
python migrate.py --selective-contacts --contact-ids "123,456,789"

# Copy contacts from specific email domains
python migrate.py --selective-contacts --email-domains "company.com,partner.org"
```

Copy only specific deals and their related contacts:

```bash
# Copy deals created in the last 30 days with all their contacts
python migrate.py --selective-deals --days-since-created 30

# Copy specific deals by ID with their contacts  
python migrate.py --selective-deals --deal-ids "111,222,333"
```

#### Rollback & Undo - Fix Mistakes

If something goes wrong, you can undo changes:

```bash
# See what can be rolled back
python migrate.py --show-rollback-options

# Undo the last migration
python migrate.py --rollback-last

# Undo the last 3 migrations
python migrate.py --rollback-last-n 3
```

#### Reset Options - Clean Slate

Remove migrated data selectively:

```bash
# Remove all records but keep custom properties and pipelines
python migrate.py --reset-records-only

# Remove all custom properties but keep records  
python migrate.py --reset-properties-only

# Remove everything the tool created (requires confirmation)
python migrate.py --full-reset
```

## What You'll See

The tool will show you progress like this:

## Safety Features

- **Test mode available** - see what would happen before doing it with `--dry-run`
- **Won't create duplicates** - updates existing records instead
- **Complete rollback** - undo any migration with `--rollback-last`
- **Selective operations** - migrate only what you need
- **Automatic backups** - detailed JSON reports of everything that happened
- **Rate limited** - won't overload HubSpot's servers
- **Newest first** - always migrates most recently created records first (sorted by creation date)

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this delete my data from the source?**
A: No! This tool only copies data. The source data remains untouched.

**Q: What if I run it twice?**
A: It's safe! The tool will update existing records instead of creating duplicates.

**Q: Can I undo a migration?**
A: Yes! Use `--rollback-last` to undo the most recent migration, or `--show-rollback-options` to see what can be undone.

**Q: Can I migrate only specific contacts?**
A: Yes! Use selective sync: `--selective-contacts --days-since-created 7` for recent contacts, or `--contact-ids "123,456"` for specific IDs.

**Q: How long does it take?**
A: For 50 contacts: about 2-3 minutes. For 1000 contacts: about 30-45 minutes.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**
A: Use `--rollback-last` to undo changes. All operations are logged in JSON reports in the `reports` folder.

**Q: Can I test without making changes?**
A: Yes! Always use `--dry-run` first to preview what will happen.

**Q: In what order are records migrated?**
A: All migrations fetch the **most recently created records first** (sorted by creation date descending). This ensures that when using limits (like `--limit 20`), you get your newest deals, contacts, etc.

## Getting Help

**If something doesn't work:**

1. **Check the logs**: Look in the `logs` folder for error details
2. **Try a smaller test**: Use `python migrate.py --limit 5` first
3. **Verify your tokens**: Make sure they start with `pat-na1-`
4. **Check permissions**: Ensure your Private Apps have all required scopes
