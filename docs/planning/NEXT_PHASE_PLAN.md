## 📋 **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Ticket Object Structure**
```python
Ticket = {
    'id': str,
    'properties': {
        'subject': str,
        'hs_ticket_priority': str,
        'hs_ticket_category': str,
        'hs_pipeline_stage': str,
        'hs_pipeline': str,
        'hubspot_owner_id': str,
        'createdate': datetime,
        'hs_lastmodifieddate': datetime,
        # ... all custom properties
    },
    'associations': {
        'contacts': [contact_ids],
        'companies': [company_ids],
        'deals': [deal_ids]
    },
    'conversations': [conversation_objects],
    'activities': [activity_objects]
}
```

### **HubSpot API Endpoints Needed**
- `GET /crm/v3/objects/tickets` - Fetch tickets
- `POST /crm/v3/objects/tickets` - Create tickets  
- `GET /crm/v3/properties/tickets` - Get ticket properties
- `POST /crm/v3/properties/tickets` - Create ticket properties
- `GET /crm/v3/pipelines/tickets` - Get ticket pipelines
- `POST /crm/v3/pipelines/tickets` - Create ticket pipelines
- `PUT /crm/v4/objects/tickets/{id}/associations/contacts/{id}` - Associate tickets
- `GET /conversations/v3/conversations/tickets/{id}` - Get conversations (if available)

### **Required HubSpot Scopes**
```
# Add to existing scopes in setup documentation:
crm.objects.tickets.read
crm.objects.tickets.write
crm.schemas.tickets.read
crm.schemas.tickets.write

# Optional for conversations:
conversations.read (if migrating conversation threads)
```

### **File Structure**
```
src/migrations/
├── ticket_property_migrator.py    # Ticket properties creation
├── ticket_pipeline_migrator.py    # Pipeline recreation  
├── ticket_migrator.py             # Core ticket migration
└── ticket_association_migrator.py # Ticket associations

src/core/
└── field_filters.py               # Add TicketFieldFilter class

src/validators/
└── ticket_validator.py            # Ticket data validation

tests/
└── test_ticket_migration.py       # Ticket migration tests
```

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Must Have (MVP)**
- [ ] All ticket properties migrated with 100% fidelity
- [ ] All ticket pipelines recreated exactly
- [ ] Ticket-contact associations preserved
- [ ] Ticket-company associations preserved  
- [ ] Ticket priorities and statuses mapped correctly

### **Should Have (Quality)**
- [ ] Ticket conversation threads preserved

- [ ] Performance optimized for 1000+ tickets

### **Could Have (Future)**

- [ ] Ticket automation workflows
- [ ] Knowledge base article links
- [ ] Advanced reporting data

## 🚨 **POTENTIAL CHALLENGES**

### **Technical Challenges**
1. **Pipeline Dependencies**: Ticket pipelines must exist before tickets
2. **Conversation Complexity**: Email threads and internal notes
3. **Association Depth**: Tickets can link to contacts, companies, and deals
4. **Status Mapping**: Different ticket statuses between portals

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Dependency Order**: Create pipelines first, then tickets
2. **Conversation Fallback**: Migrate as notes if conversation API unavailable  
3. **Batch Processing**: Handle complex associations in batches
4. **Status Validation**: Map and validate status transitions

## 📊 **TESTING STRATEGY**

### **Unit Tests**
- Test ticket property migration
- Test pipeline recreation
- Test association mapping
- Validate field filtering

### **Integration Tests**  
- Test full ticket migration workflow
- Test with real HubSpot sandbox
- Validate all associations work
- Test performance with large datasets

### **User Acceptance Tests**
- Test with real support workflows
- Validate ticket history preservation
- Test edge cases and error recovery
- Performance testing under load
