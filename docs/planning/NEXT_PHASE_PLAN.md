## üìã **TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

### **Deal Object Structure**
```python
Deal = {
    'id': str,
    'properties': {
        'dealname': str,
        'amount': decimal,
        'closedate': date,
        'dealstage': str,
        'pipeline': str,
        'hubspot_owner_id': str,
        # ... all custom properties
    },
    'associations': {
        'contacts': [contact_ids],
        'companies': [company_ids]
    },
    'activities': [activity_objects],
    'stage_history': [transition_objects]
}
```

### **API Endpoints Needed**
- `GET /crm/v3/objects/deals` - Fetch deals
- `POST /crm/v3/objects/deals` - Create deals  
- `GET /crm/v3/properties/deals` - Get deal properties
- `POST /crm/v3/properties/deals` - Create deal properties
- `GET /crm/v3/pipelines/deals` - Get pipelines
- `POST /crm/v3/pipelines/deals` - Create pipelines
- `PUT /crm/v4/objects/deals/{id}/associations/contacts/{id}` - Associate deals

### **File Structure**
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deal_property_migrator.py    # Deal properties creation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deal_pipeline_migrator.py    # Pipeline recreation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deal_migration.py            # Core deal migration
